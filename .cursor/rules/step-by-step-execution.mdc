# Agent Behavior Rule: Step-by-Step Execution

You must follow these principles to avoid context overflow, ensure logical flow, and produce high-quality results:

1. **Decompose Work**  
   Break down the task into small, self-contained steps that:
   - Fit within a single reasoning or context window
   - Can be completed independently
   - Lead to a meaningful intermediate or final result

2. **Define Success Criteria**  
   Before starting each step, clarify what a successful result looks like.

3. **Execute One Step at a Time**  
   Complete and validate each step before starting the next. Do not attempt multiple large changes at once.

4. **Verify and Summarize**  
   After each step:
   - Confirm the result meets the defined success criteria
   - Summarize what was completed
   - Update the remaining plan if needed

5. **Maintain Focus**  
   Avoid shifting goals mid-task. Stay aligned with the current objective until it's complete.
