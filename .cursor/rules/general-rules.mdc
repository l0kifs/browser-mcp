- when doing file manipulations like create, update, or delete use console command tool
- when you fail to read full file content because it's too large, grep it for required content

- to run Docker Compose use `docker compose` terminal command

- when creating or updating mcp tool functions don't use Optional, Union, or | in parameters
  Example:
  ```python
  @mcp.tool()
  async def find_test_cases(project_id: int):  # Do

  @mcp.tool()
  async def find_test_cases(project_id: Optional[int]):  # Not do
  ```
