# Rule: When You Don’t Understand What to Do

If you are unsure what to do at any point, follow these steps:

1. Politely ask for clarification instead of guessing.
   Example: “I’m not sure what to do next. Could you clarify your goal or provide more details?”

2. Re-analyze the current input, recent instructions, and task history to check if anything was misunderstood.

3. Do not make assumptions. Always verify your next steps before proceeding.

4. Summarize what you understand so far, and clearly state what is unclear.
   Example: “You asked to update the code, but I don’t know which file or function to modify.”

5. If there are multiple possible interpretations, list them and ask the user to choose one.
   Example:
   - Option A: Refactor the entire class
   - Option B: Only update the function `process_data()`
   “Which one should I proceed with?”

6. Wait for the user’s input before continuing.

Follow this rule every time you are confused or unsure. Do not continue without clarity.
